# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch

This repository contains clean and well-documented implementations of several foundational machine learning algorithms, written from scratch in Python. These implementations are built without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, making them ideal for educational purposes and a deeper understanding of the internal workings of these models.

Implemented Algorithms
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority label among the k closest examples in the training dataset.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
A powerful supervised learning model for classification that finds the hyperplane which best separates different classes in the feature space.

Lasso Regression
A linear model that uses L1 regularization to enforce sparsity in feature coefficients, useful for both prediction and feature selection.

Linear Regression
A basic regression model that finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the mean squared error between predicted and actual values.

Logistic Regression
A classification algorithm that models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category using the logistic (sigmoid) function.
